      In a vast cinematic kingdom known as "The Land of Light and Shadow," two unique species of films reside. Though they share the same land, they captivate audiences in vastly different ways, becoming topics of fascination among movie enthusiasts.

      Thus, as investigators, we took on this mission and set foot on the soil of the Land of Light and Shadow. We sought to uncover the secrets behind these two vastly different types of films. Why do they exhibit such extreme performances? Is it merely the result of market coincidences, or are there intrinsic qualities within films driving these phenomena?
      
      This marks the beginning of our journey—to traverse the polarized realms of the cinematic world in search of the balance, or the imbalance, that lies between box office success and audience ratings.

      These little sprites did not come into existence out of thin air; each of them possesses a precious “birth certificate”. These magical details are carefully stored, ready to tell each film's unique story! 

      The “birth certificate” also reveals something extraordinary: spirites were born on the distant planet Earth, crafted by magical “craftsmen” known as actors and actresses. These forgers used their wisdom and imagination to bring the movie sprites to life, and each certificate lists not only the sprites’ identities but also their brilliant creators.
