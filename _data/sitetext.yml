      In a vast cinematic kingdom known as "The Land of Light and Shadow," two unique species of films reside. Though they share the same land, they captivate audiences in vastly different ways, becoming topics of fascination among movie enthusiasts.

      Thus, as investigators, we took on this mission and set foot on the soil of the Land of Light and Shadow. We sought to uncover the secrets behind these two vastly different types of films. Why do they exhibit such extreme performances? Is it merely the result of market coincidences, or are there intrinsic qualities within films driving these phenomena?
      
      This marks the beginning of our journey—to traverse the polarized realms of the cinematic world in search of the balance, or the imbalance, that lies between box office success and audience ratings.

      These little sprites did not come into existence out of thin air; each of them possesses a precious “birth certificate”. These magical details are carefully stored, ready to tell each film's unique story! 

      The “birth certificate” also reveals something extraordinary: spirites were born on the distant planet Earth, crafted by magical “craftsmen” known as actors and actresses. These forgers used their wisdom and imagination to bring the movie sprites to life, and each certificate lists not only the sprites’ identities but also their brilliant creators.

      Great job! The box office and ratings we care about are also in this dataset! 

      But hold on, can they be used directly?

      Let’s take a look at how box office revenue changes over time!
    image: assets\img\certificate\revenue.png
    text2: |
      Why does box office revenue keep increasing? Are those old movies really not popular?

      In fact, the answer doesn’t lie in the movies themselves but in a kind of magic cast by time!
    text3: |
      We must understand that, just like in our human world, the cinematic kingdom faces an unavoidable problem—inflation. The value of "MovieCoin" from a hundred years ago is vastly different from what it is today! Those classic films from the last century, although they earned a fortune at the time, might have their achievements overshadowed by modern blockbusters if we don’t account for the changes over time. After all, 100 million MovieCoins today might be a mere drop in the bucket, while in the past, it was enough to shake the entire kingdom.

      To ensure that those "old-timers" from history receive a fair evaluation, we decided to use a powerful tool—the CPI Index (Consumer Price Index). It acts as a "temporal balance," allowing us to transcend time and adjust the values of the past to match those of the present on an equal footing.
    text4: Hummmm, that looks much more reasonable now!
    text5: |
      Alright, with these "identifications" in hand, our investigation has finally entered the next phase. How can we actually distinguish these rare groups from the ordinary ones? Just like the Sorting Hat in Harry Potter! We think that before developing such a "magic hat," we need to take a closer look at the relationship between ratings and box office revenue, as well as their connections with various identity attributes!
      
      Oh, right! We took the ADA course! The one we took before all this began. That course wasn’t just about crunching numbers or making pretty charts. It taught us something more—a kind of “magic,” the ability to dig beneath the surface and reveal hidden truths using data and models. Maybe, just maybe, this is the tool we need to crack the mysteries of the Land of Light and Shadow. Let’s give it a try.

      Alright, with these "identifications" in hand, our investigation moves to the next phase. How can we distinguish these rare groups from the ordinary ones? Like the Sorting Hat in Harry Potter! Before crafting such a "magic hat," we need to analyze the relationship between ratings, box office revenue, and identity attributes.
      
      Oh, right! Remember the ADA course we took? It wasn’t just about numbers or charts—it taught us the “magic” of uncovering hidden truths with data and models. Maybe this is the key to solving the mysteries of the Land of Light and Shadow. Let’s give it a shot.
    text1: |
      Here is the "species distribution chart," mapping the entirety of the Land of Light and Shadow and resembling a star map that reveals the destiny of films. Each point represents a movie, with the horizontal axis depicting global box office performance, and the vertical axis showing IMDb ratings, symbolizing recognition from audiences and critics. In the center of this chart, we see a densely packed area where the concentration of points is particularly high. This region corresponds to movies with ratings between 6 and 7 and box office revenues roughly between $14 and $16 billion—films that are neither too bad nor particularly remarkable. These movies resemble the “ordinary species” of the Land of Light and Shadow: abundant in number, relatively uncontroversial, appealing to the general audience, but rarely leaving a lasting impression.
    text4: |
      We’ve already gotten a pretty good sense of the ordinary species, but honestly, what really intrigues me are those rare, unique groups！
      
      Still, pulling them out of the distribution chart? That’s no easy task. Maybe… just maybe, the linear regression method we learned in the ADA course could work. Let’s give it a shot！
    text2: |
      First, we drew a regression line across all the points, representing the normal relationship between box office performance and ratings. But the rare species refuse to settle for mediocrity; their fates must deviate from this line! To track them down, we shifted the regression line up and down by one standard deviation. In this way, the chart was divided into three distinct regions:

      If a movie's point falls above the upper regression line and its rating is below 6.5, it is classified as "Overperformed." These movies radiate a brilliant red glow in the upper left corner of the chart.

      Conversely, points below the lower regression line with ratings above 6.5 belong to the "Hidden Gems." These movies emit a soft blue glow in the lower right corner of the chart.
    text3: Excellent! We’ve distinguished them! Now let’s take a closer look at the characteristics of these two groups!
    text6: The cinematic kingdom is complex and diverse, with its fate profoundly shaped by the passage of time and the diversity of global audiences.
    text7: Across the vast landscape of the cinematic kingdom, each country's film market tells its own story. In North America, the "Overperformed" species shines like red sparks, dominating the box office with the power of strong marketing and star appeal, yet the connection between ratings and revenue is weak. In France, the "Hidden Gems" glow softly like blue fireflies, winning audiences with their artistic value. Despite modest box office results, their high ratings highlight their unique charm. South Korea’s film market is a stage of red and blue interwoven, where commercial blockbusters coexist with art films, showcasing a divided yet richly diverse cultural scene. These geographical differences add vibrant colors to the destiny of films and make cinema a truly global art form that transcends culture and language.
    text8: Across the river of time, the red "Overperformed" and blue "Hidden Gems" left their unique marks in each era. By 1935, both groups began to emerge. The real explosion, however, started in 1975, when both groups rapidly grew, dotting the distribution charts of every decade, particularly standing out in 2005. From the trajectory of the red and blue points, we witness the interplay between commerce and art.
    text9: Oh, but what about language? That’s something we hadn’t considered deeply before. Let’s dive in and map it out—this time with a 3D bar chart. Each bar’s height represents the ratio of overperformed to underperformed films for each language.
    text10: |
      The data reveals some interesting phenomena in the cinematic kingdom. Languages with the highest overperformer-to-underperformer ratios include Hungarian, Russian, Italian, Arabic, and Mandarin Chinese, with films in these languages standing out in their unique markets. In contrast, English-language films are relatively "guilt-free" in this regard, maintaining a balance between the red "Overperformed" and blue "Hidden Gems," with a higher proportion of ordinary films.
      
      This trend reflects the unique roles these languages play in the cinematic kingdom. Films in Hungarian, Russian, and Italian typically occupy a niche in regional or arthouse markets, where they can exceed expectations when they resonate with viewers. When these films succeed, they shine like red "Overperformed" films, breaking through their small-scale limits to become dazzling stars.
      
      Mandarin Chinese and Arabic films represent emerging forces in the cinematic kingdom. Rooted in markets with strong local demand, they are gradually attracting global attention. When these films strike the perfect balance, they can rise from blue "Hidden Gems" to red "Overperformed" films, excelling in both local and international markets.
      
      However, English-language films face a different challenge. With their large output and broad appeal, English-language films flood the cinematic kingdom with a wide variety of stories. This abundance leads to a dilution effect, where red "Overperformed" films and blue "Hidden Gems" often get lost among the large number of ordinary films, resulting in both successes and failures.
    text11: Huh! So how are the genres distributed within these two groups? This is crucial!
    text12: |
      In the overperformed group, the Thriller genre stands head and shoulders above the rest. These films captivate large audiences with their intense, gripping plots and suspenseful twists. Despite receiving relatively low ratings, they dominate the box office. This seems to reflect audiences' craving for strong emotional experiences or perhaps highlights key factors, such as star-studded casts or marketing strategies, that drive their success.
      In the underperformed group, the Drama genre takes the undisputed lead. These films earn high ratings through their profound storytelling and outstanding performances, yet fail to achieve corresponding box office success. Perhaps the introspective and weighty nature of dramas makes them more suited for critical acclaim and niche audiences rather than widespread commercial appeal.

    text14: Ah! So it’s them! Those craftsmen who have consistently lit up the box office in overperforming films! And those who... Due to bad timing, poor choices, or simply bad luck.
