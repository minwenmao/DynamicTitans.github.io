      In a vast cinematic kingdom known as "The Land of Light and Shadow," two unique species of films reside. Though they share the same land, they captivate audiences in vastly different ways, becoming topics of fascination among movie enthusiasts.

      Thus, as investigators, we took on this mission and set foot on the soil of the Land of Light and Shadow. We sought to uncover the secrets behind these two vastly different types of films. Why do they exhibit such extreme performances? Is it merely the result of market coincidences, or are there intrinsic qualities within films driving these phenomena?
      
      This marks the beginning of our journey—to traverse the polarized realms of the cinematic world in search of the balance, or the imbalance, that lies between box office success and audience ratings.

      These little sprites, or "movie spirits," as they are lovingly referred to, are not simply born out of thin air. Each one of them holds a precious "birth certificate," a symbol of their identity and origin. On this document, the details of their creation are meticulously recorded, including their "date of birth," "nationality," "height," and many other unique traits that define who they are. These magical details are carefully stored in an enchanting archive, each ready to unfold the extraordinary story of the film they belong to.

      Great job! The box office and ratings we care about are also in this dataset! 

      But hold on, can they be used directly?

      Let’s take a look at how box office revenue changes over time!
    image: assets\img\certificate\revenue.png
    text2: |
      Why does box office revenue keep increasing? Are those old movies really not popular?

      In fact, the answer doesn’t lie in the movies themselves but in a kind of magic cast by time!
    text3: |
      We must understand that, just like in our human world, the cinematic kingdom faces an unavoidable problem—inflation. The value of "MovieCoin" from a hundred years ago is vastly different from what it is today! Those classic films from the last century, although they earned a fortune at the time, might have their achievements overshadowed by modern blockbusters if we don’t account for the changes over time. After all, 100 million MovieCoins today might be a mere drop in the bucket, while in the past, it was enough to shake the entire kingdom.

      To ensure that those "old-timers" from history receive a fair evaluation, we decided to use a powerful tool—the CPI Index (Consumer Price Index). It acts as a "temporal balance," allowing us to transcend time and adjust the values of the past to match those of the present on an equal footing.
    text4: |
      Hummmm, that looks much more reasonable now!

      But the group we’re focusing on... should be located in the top-left and bottom-right corners of the chart, right? At least, that’s what the compass indicates!
    text5: |
      Alright, with these "identifications" in hand, our investigation has finally entered the next phase. How can we actually distinguish these rare groups from the ordinary ones? Just like the Sorting Hat in Harry Potter! We think that before developing such a "magic hat," we need to take a closer look at the relationship between ratings and box office revenue, as well as their connections with various identity attributes!
      
      Oh, right! We took the ADA course! The one we took before all this began. That course wasn’t just about crunching numbers or making pretty charts. It taught us something more—a kind of “magic,” the ability to dig beneath the surface and reveal hidden truths using data and models. Maybe, just maybe, this is the tool we need to crack the mysteries of the Land of Light and Shadow. Let’s give it a try.

    title: "Craftmen Certificate"
    texta: " Here is the 'species distribution chart,' mapping the entirety of the Land of Light and Shadow and resembling a star map that reveals the destiny of films. Each point represents a movie, with the horizontal axis depicting global box office performance, and the vertical axis showing IMDb ratings, symbolizing recognition from audiences and critics. In the center of this chart, we see a densely packed area where the concentration of points is particularly high. This region corresponds to movies with ratings between 6 and 7 and box office revenues roughly between $14 and $16 billion—films that are neither too bad nor particularly remarkable. These movies resemble the “ordinary species” of the Land of Light and Shadow: abundant in number, relatively uncontroversial, appealing to the general audience, but rarely leaving a lasting impression."

    text4: |
      We’ve already gotten a pretty good sense of the ordinary species, but honestly, what really intrigues me are those rare, unique groups！
      
      Still, pulling them out of the distribution chart? That’s no easy task. Maybe… just maybe, the linear regression method we learned in the ADA course could work. Let’s give it a shot！
    text2: |
      First, we drew a regression line across all the points, representing the normal relationship between box office performance and ratings. But the rare species refuse to settle for mediocrity; their fates must deviate from this line! To track them down, we shifted the regression line up and down by one standard deviation. In this way, the chart was divided into three distinct regions:

      If a movie's point falls above the upper regression line and its rating is below 6.5, it is classified as "Overperformed." These movies radiate a brilliant red glow in the upper left corner of the chart.

      Conversely, points below the lower regression line with ratings above 6.5 belong to the "Underperformed." These movies emit a soft blue glow in the lower right corner of the chart.
    text3: Excellent! We’ve distinguished them! Now let’s take a closer look at the characteristics of these two groups!
    text6: The cinematic kingdom is complex and diverse, with its fate profoundly shaped by the passage of time and the diversity of global audiences.
    text7: Across the vast landscape of the cinematic kingdom, each country's film market tells its own story. In North America, the "Overperformed" species shines like red sparks, dominating the box office with the power of strong marketing and star appeal, yet the connection between ratings and revenue is weak. In France, the "Underperformed" glow softly like blue fireflies, winning audiences with their artistic value. Despite modest box office results, their high ratings highlight their unique charm. South Korea’s film market is a stage of red and blue interwoven, where commercial blockbusters coexist with art films, showcasing a divided yet richly diverse cultural scene. These geographical differences add vibrant colors to the destiny of films and make cinema a truly global art form that transcends culture and language.
    text8: Across the river of time, the red "Overperformed" and blue "Underperformed" left their unique marks in each era. By 1935, both groups began to emerge. The real explosion, however, started in 1975, when both groups rapidly grew, dotting the distribution charts of every decade, particularly standing out in 2005. From the trajectory of the red and blue points, we witness the interplay between commerce and art.
    text9: Oh, but what about language? That’s something we hadn’t considered deeply before. Let’s dive in and map it out—this time with a 3D bar chart. Each bar’s height represents the ratio of Overperformed to Underperformed films for each language.
    text10: |
      The data reveals some interesting phenomena in the cinematic kingdom. Languages with the highest overperformer-to-underperformer ratios include Hungarian, Russian, Italian, Arabic, and Mandarin Chinese, with films in these languages standing out in their unique markets. In contrast, English-language films are relatively "guilt-free" in this regard, maintaining a balance between the red "Overperformed" and blue "Underperformed," with a higher proportion of ordinary films.
      
      This trend reflects the unique roles these languages play in the cinematic kingdom. Films in Hungarian, Russian, and Italian typically occupy a niche in regional or arthouse markets, where they can exceed expectations when they resonate with viewers. When these films succeed, they shine like red "Overperformed" films, breaking through their small-scale limits to become dazzling stars.
      
      Mandarin Chinese and Arabic films represent emerging forces in the cinematic kingdom. Rooted in markets with strong local demand, they are gradually attracting global attention. When these films strike the perfect balance, they can rise from blue "Underperformed" to red "Overperformed" films, excelling in both local and international markets.
      
      However, English-language films face a different challenge. With their large output and broad appeal, English-language films flood the cinematic kingdom with a wide variety of stories. This abundance leads to a dilution effect, where red "Overperformed" films and blue "Underperformed" often get lost among the large number of ordinary films, resulting in both successes and failures.
    text11: Huh! So how are the genres distributed within these two groups? This is crucial!
    text12: |
      In the Overperformed group, the Thriller genre stands head and shoulders above the rest. These films captivate large audiences with their intense, gripping plots and suspenseful twists. Despite receiving relatively low ratings, they dominate the box office. This seems to reflect audiences' craving for strong emotional experiences or perhaps highlights key factors, such as star-studded casts or marketing strategies, that drive their success.
      
      In the Underperformed group, the Drama genre takes the undisputed lead. These films earn high ratings through their profound storytelling and outstanding performances, yet fail to achieve corresponding box office success. Perhaps the introspective and weighty nature of dramas makes them more suited for critical acclaim and niche audiences rather than widespread commercial appeal.
    subtitle2: Sorting Hat(Classification)
    body: "The “Craftsmen Certificate” also reveals something extraordinary: spirites were born on the distant planet Earth, crafted by magical “craftsmen” known as actors and actresses. These forgers used their wisdom and imagination to bring the movie sprites to life, and each certificate lists not only the sprites’ identities but also their brilliant creators. The names of these magical craftsmen are meticulously recorded, alongside details such as their gender, date of birth, race, and other defining traits. These pieces of information serve as a celebration of the individuals behind the magic, offering a glimpse into the diverse and talented minds responsible for these cinematic wonders."
    text13: Who are the main creators of these two groups? Let's take a look!
    text14: Ah! So it’s them! Those craftsmen who have consistently lit up the box office in overperforming films! And those who... Due to bad timing, poor choices, or simply bad luck.
    text15: Oh, right! We can also explore this through the chord diagram below. This chart will allow us to see how each "primary" genre of film corresponds to the gender of the "craftsmen" — the actors and actresses featured in these films.
    title1: 'Act I: Time - the mysterious power of birth date'
    textb: In the land of light and shadow, the release year of each movie is like its "birth date", which determines the market environment, technical level and audience demand it faces when it is born. Movie elves of different ages seem to bear the imprint of their respective eras - some carry the cutting edge of technological innovation, and some reflect the wave of social change.
    textc: We regard the release year of a movie as "time" to explore how the era background of the movie genie's "birth" affects its ratings and sales. For example, the science fiction movie elf "Star Wars" in the 1970s became a global phenomenon in the technological and cultural context of the time; and the wave of super movie elves since the 21st century has benefited from the leap in visual effects technology and the rise of the global market. We collected the release years of the movies, corresponding to the relationship between "time" and ratings and revenue, and explored the inevitable impact of this dimension on the success of the movie elf.
    textd: For example, the total revenue of movie spirits experienced a brief decline between 1980 and 1983, with the booming growth of the VHS/LaserDisc market being a key factor. Following this period, revenues entered a phase of rapid growth, reaching a peak of $25 billion in 2010, only to quickly decline thereafter, dropping to just $18 billion by 2012. Meanwhile, the average ratings of movie spirits remained stable throughout, generally staying between 6 and 7.
    title2: 'Act II: Geographical advantage - the cultural imprint of the nation'
    texte: Everyone's birthplace has a unique cultural background and environmental characteristics, just like the corresponding constellations in the night sky determine certain aspects of everyone's personality. Movies are no exception. The country of release is like its "birthplace", leaving a deep cultural imprint on each work. This "geographical advantage" not only affects the style and content of the film, but may also subtly determine its rating and fate.
    textf: |
      In "Light and Shadow Paradise", we created different regions in the starry sky that each country likes, and their unique culture, audience preferences and filmmaking traditions shape the fate of the film. For example, in the Yangtze River Delta in China, this film "Land" seems to correspond to "Virgo" - clear thinking, thrifty and low-key, kind-hearted, and breeds amazing detail-oriented and story-telling films. Although these films are not visually dazzling, their profound themes and narratives are often memorable. The same logic applies to other parts of the world: the United States may correspond to "Leo", whose creators are flamboyant and full of joy and fun, so Hollywood blockbusters can always top the auction with shocking effects and concise plots; while France is as high as "Aquarius", free and romantic, and good at making unique and artistically expressive films.
    textg: |
      We counted and classified the "nationals" of each movie genie, trying to reveal the relationship between "geographical advantage" and ratings and revenue. Is there a legacy of some excellent cultural genes behind their success? Why do some films produce movies for a long time, while others are always tepid? By analyzing these "geographical factors", we hope to deeply understand the unique positioning of films from different countries in the global market.

      Over time, the number of movie spirits has grown strongly, and the trading market has rapidly expanded (with the average income of movie spirits increasing). However, it is evident that the fastest growth in both population and income has been among American movie spirits.
    title3: 'Act III: The combination of time, place and people - the mystery of film length'
    texth: |
      'As we explore the direct impact of "time" (release date) and "place" (release country) on the development of movies, a more subtle question that comes to mind is: Is there a race that can be negated by both time and place, while also reflecting the influence of people? At this moment, we have an inspiration: height, that is, the runtime of the movie, is not a perfect example?
      Just as a person's height is determined by genes and growth, the height of a movie genie is also a trade-off between artistic expression and audience acceptance by directors, screenwriters and producers. About 70% of the determinants of height come from innate genes, and the remaining 30% are shaped by the acquired environment and other factors. Therefore, the height of a movie genie is also affected by time and place, while reflecting the role of humans.
    subtitle1: The relationship between duration and time
    textii: 'Each era has different acceptance of height: in the era of underdeveloped technology, the height of the film elf was limited by the capacity of the film, and short films were mostly used; in modern times, technological innovation and the improvement of cinema equipment have made long-form blockbusters possible. It not only affects the basic range of film elf height, but also provides creators with new artistic possibilities.'
    subtitle2: The interaction between duration and location
    text22: In Eastern cultures such as China, attention is paid to details and patience, and long reports are easily recognized; in the European and American markets, dimension films with sequential arrangement and continuous plots are more popular. Cultural background  determines the preference for the height film elf and its complex relationship with possession and rating. For example, films borned in the Yangtze River Delta often fit the characteristics of "Virgo", and the height of the film elf is often moderate, which can take into account the depth of the narrative and the structure of the rhythm
    text33: By analyzing the height of the movie genie, we hope to reveal how time, place and people merge to jointly shape the fate of a movie. The height is not only a choice to narrate the movie, but also the final result after the balance between time, place and people. Combining the cultural background, era and audience preferences of the film, the potential rules of rating and distribution success in the land of light and shadow are revealed.
    text44: Movie spirits with higher ratings and revenues are often taller but fewer in number (exceeding 200 minutes). However, the majority of movie spirits are concentrated at a height of around 100 minutes, where their ratings and revenues are relatively average.
    text55: 'Through this foundational analysis, we have discovered several groups that perform exceptionally well in one aspect while falling significantly behind in another. We classify these spirits into two categories: the "Overperformers" and the "Underperformed", aiming to identify these unique groups and uncover their "special" secrets.'
    text66: This is an incredibly exciting endeavor! We will employ a magical "Sorting Hat" to detect their hidden tribes. Let the journey begin!

    text: What? Amazing! We've gained access to the Movie Spirits Archive!
    body: |
      This place is brimming with magic and the essence of storytelling. Looking around, we see towering bookshelves spiraling upward like reels of film, while floating pages and glowing screens seem to whisper. Each diary was no ordinary book; it was alive with whispers of emotions and tales yet to be told. These diaries, known as the "Chronicles of Sentiment," were said to hold the essence of countless emotions.
    text1: But with all these long passages of text... Where should we even begin?
    text2: 
    text3: The librarians wielded the powerful BERT spell, classifying these emotions into twelve distinct categories. Among the first 80 movies they explored, worry took the lead, like a shadow casting tension and drama over the plots. At the same time, surprise sparkled like fireworks, igniting the audience's curiosity and making the stories even more captivating. Neutral emotions, like a sturdy foundation, quietly maintained the rhythm of the narrative, ensuring a more balanced emotional flow.
    text4: 'The SnowNLP spell acts like a magical thread, weaving together fragments of emotion! It assigns each sentence a sentiment score ranging from 0 (negative) to 1 (positive). As this spell is cast, we uncover the emotional tides of each story: the peaks and valleys of sentiment that ebb and flow within the world of the movie sprites. It is these undulating emotional curves that bring the movie sprites to life, imbuing them with unique vibrancy, rich personality, and captivating brilliance.'
    text5: Let's take a more comprehensive look by attempting to visualize distribution of the FIRST most common and SECOND most common emotions among two groups, respectively.  
    text6: “Worry” unsurprisingly dominates the most common sentiment, but looking at the second most common, the Overperformed group shows a higher percentage of "surprise." This likely reflects their ability to deliver twists, revelations, or awe-inspiring moments that leave lasting impressions, effectively overshadowing any perceived flaws in the eyes of critics. In contrast, the Underperformed group leans more towards "neutral" or other less dynamic emotions. This suggests that, while their craftsmanship may be exceptional, these movies often lack the memorable or impactful emotional beats needed to sustain audience engagement, causing them to remain underappreciated by the broader market.
    text7: Hmm! This is quite good, but since these emotions are arranged in sequence, what interesting conclusions could we draw if we consider the transitions between emotions?
    text8: We quantify how a use of emotion follows another in movie plots through identifying significant emotional fluctuations - where the sentiment either rises or falls larger than a certain amount. We then plot the distribution of the number of fluctuations among both the overperformers and the underperformers.
    text9: |
      Each entry in the diaries was composed of countless sentence fragments, tiny shards of thoughts and feelings woven together like the strands of a spider's web. The librarians, who were no ordinary keepers of books, treated each sentence as a precious, individual unit of analysis. With great care, they examined these fragments, delving deep into their hidden meanings.

      But their work didn’t stop there. Using ancient and mysterious spells, the librarians cast enchantments over each sentence, marking its emotional category and sentiment polarity. A single word might glow with joy, while another shimmered with sorrow or burned with anger. These magical annotations transformed the simple words into a symphony of emotions, giving life to the pages and allowing the diaries to truly speak. 
    title: The Diary of Movie Spirits.
    text10: |
      The difference is striking: Underperformed are skewed toward fewer emotional fluctuations, rarely exceeding 14, suggesting more static or predictable emotional trajectories. In contrast, the Overperformed group shows a more balanced distribution around 12-13 fluctuations, with higher averages overall.

      This is yet another sign among many others of how the Overperformed group seemingly “manipulates” audiences into being emotionally (and financially) invested by dynamically shifting emotions throughout the plot, incorporating more twists and turns in total—compared to their Underperformed counterparts, who may fail to hold attention due to (perceived) flatter emotional arcs that lack variety or impact.

      We can approach a similar conclusion upon plotting the distribution of the total magnitude of fluctuation—i.e., the absolute difference between the maximum and the minimum—for both groups. Once again, the Overperformed group tends towards a higher fluctuation magnitude overall than the Underperformed.
    text11: 'What seemingly challenges this is when we try to reveal the trends of sentiment change in either the Overperformed group or the Underperformed group, by performing linear regression on each entry in each. The intercept of the regression line should be a decent shorthand of the total, or initial, sentiment of the movie, while the slope represents the overall sentimental shift of each movie. We once again plot their distribution:'
    text12: |
      Both the Overperformed group and the Underperformed group with meaningful sentiment arcs are more likely to exhibit an upward trajectory (negative to positive), reflecting the universal appeal of stories that move toward resolution or hope. Surprisingly, and seemingly contradicting our conclusions about the Overperformed group “manipulating” audiences into engagement, they tend to have lower slopes, indicating smaller overall sentiment shifts compared to the Underperformed.
      
      Even this apparent contradiction has an explanation—perhaps even a clever twist on our assumptions about the Overperformed group. They don’t need their plots to move neatly from sadness to happiness; instead, they might be playing a subtler game. By expertly manipulating audience emotions within smaller shifts, they create a dynamic viewing experience that feels richer and more engaging without relying on a dramatic overall arc. Maybe it’s precisely because these films don’t commit to clear-cut sentiment trajectories that they manage to surprise and exceed audience expectations—even at the expense of critical approval. Who needs a concrete story arc when you can keep viewers on the edge of their seats?
      
      Alternatively, the Overperformed group might be winning audiences over from the get-go, starting with a more positive tone that hooks viewers early on. It could be that critics—trained to analyze structure and subtlety—value coherence and upward arcs, while general audiences are more easily swayed by in-the-moment emotional highs and an inviting opening vibe.
      
      In the end, maybe we’ve misjudged the Overperformed group. It turns out they might not be “manipulating” their way to success after all. Or, who knows—maybe they’ve just mastered the art of emotional sleight of hand, leaving us all guessing what really makes them tick. Either way, it’s a reminder that there’s rarely one simple formula for what works in cinema.
